=== Limit Login Attempts ===
Contributors: johanee
Tags: login, security, authentication
Requires at least: 2.8
Tested up to: 3.0.1
Stable tag: 1.7.1

Limit rate of login attempts for each IP. Also support additional security for password reset, rate limit on new user registrations, and more.

== Description ==

THIS IS A BETA VERSION!

Additional security features for many parts of user handling: login, signup, password reset and more.

Limit the number of login attempts possible both through normal login as well as using auth cookies.

By default WordPress allows unlimited login attempts either through the login page or by sending special cookies. This allows passwords (or hashes) to be brute-force cracked with relative ease.

Limit Login Attempts blocks an Internet address from making further attempts after a specified limit on retries is reached, making a brute-force attack difficult or impossible.

** TODO!!

Additional security features for many parts of user handling: login, signup, password reset and more.

The plugin also help you protect user login names from discovery. This includes password reset attempts for privileged users, rate limit on new user registrations. TODO: spam accounts

== Installation ==

1. Download and extract plugin files to a folder in your wp-content/plugin directory.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why not reset failed attempts on a successful login? =

This is very much by design. Otherwise you could brute force the "admin" password by logging in as your own user every 4th attempt.

= What is this option about site connection and reverse proxy? =

A reverse proxy is a server in between the site and the Internet (perhaps handling caching or load-balancing). This makes getting the correct client IP to block slightly more complicated.

The option default to NOT being behind a proxy -- which should be by far the common case.

= How do I know if my site is behind a reverse proxy? =

You probably are not or you would know. We show a pretty good guess on the option page. Set the option using this unless you are sure you know better.

= I locked myself out testing this thing, what do I do? =

Either wait, or:

If you have ftp / ssh access to the site rename the file `wp-content/plugins/limit-login-attempts/limit-login-attempts.php` to deactivate the plugin.

If you have access to the database (for example through phpMyAdmin) you can clear the `limit_login_lockouts` option in the wordpress options table.

Don't do this unless you know what you are doing.

In a default setup this would work: `UPDATE wp_options SET option_value = '' WHERE option_name = 'limit_login_lockouts'`

= I disabled password reset for administrators and forgot my password, what do I do? =

If you have ftp / ssh access look at the answer regarding being locked out above to disable plugin. Reset password before re-enabling plugin.

If you have access to the database (for example through phpMyAdmin) you can remove the plugin options value. This will revert settings to default values which allow password reset using account e-mail (for privileged users).

Plugin options are stored in `limit_login_options` option in the wordpress options table. You can remove this in a default setup using: `DELETE FROM wp_options WHERE option_name = 'limit_login_options'`. PLEASE BE CAREFUL OR YOU MIGHT SCREW UP YOUR WORDPRESS INSTALL!

Truly advanced users can edit the 'disable_pwd_reset' entry in the serialized array.

* Updated Bulgarian translation, thanks to Hristo Chakarov

* Checkpoint release for translations
* Added basic functionality to edit user nicenames
* Added Wordpress version dependency for password reset functionality
* Code clean-ups

= Version 2.0beta2 =
* Many various fixes and improvements! (sorry, no detailed notes)

= Version 2.0beta1 =
* Added a number of options that when activated make it harder to find login names of users
* disable password reset using username (accept user email only) for users with a specified role or higher
* disable password reset for users with a specified role or higher
* restrict rate of new user registrations
* filter registration error messages to avoid possible way to brute force find user login name
* list of privileged users show which login names can be discovered from user displayname, nickname or "url name"/nicename

= 1.6.2 =
* Fix bug where log would not get updated after it had been cleared
* Do plugin setup in 'init' action
* Small update to Spanish translation file, thanks to Marcelo Pedra
* Tested against WordPress 3.2.1

= 1.6.1 =
* (WordPress 3.0+) An invalid cookie can sometimes get sent multiple times before it gets cleared, resulting in multiple failed attempts or even a lockout from a single invalid cookie. Store the latest failed cookie to make sure we only count it as one failed attempt
* Define "Text Domain" correctly
* Include correct Dutch tranlation file. Thanks to Martin1 for noticing. Thanks again to Bjorn Wijers for the translation
* Updated POT file for this version
* Tested against WordPress 3.1-RC4

= 1.6.0 =
* Happy New Year
* Tested against WordPress 3.1-RC1
* Plugin now requires WordPress version 2.8+. Of course you should never ever use anything but the latest version
* Fixed deprecation warnings that had been piling up with the old version requirement. Thanks to Johannes Ruthenberg for the report that prompted this
* Removed auth cookie admin check for version 2.7.
* Make sure relevant values in $_COOKIE get cleared right away on auth cookie validation failure. There are still some problems with cookie auth handling. The lockout can trigger prematurely in rare cases, but fixing it is plugin version 2 stuff unfortunately.
* Changed default time for retries to reset from 24 hours to 12 hours. The security impact is very minor and it means the warning will disappear "overnight"
* Added question to FAQ ("Why not reset failed attempts on a successful login?")
* Updated screenshots
